            <p>
                I'm a computer programmer currently working towards my BS in
                Computer Science. I always dreamt about what a career in software
                development would feel like, but I never developed software in a
                professional capacity; only personal projects where I was the sole
                developer. I have tried web development, mobile app development,
                game development but I would rather focus on low level programming
                hardware abstraction concepts and target platforms such as bare-metal,
                x86-64 linux, and embedded linux. I also use my 32-bit RISC-V Pinecil
                for small soldering projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first programming language I learned was QBasic, on my
                IBM 286 clone running windows 95 back in 1995.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I have spare time, I do a bit of Linux systems administration,
                work on this website, and retro pc/console game prototypes just to name
                a few things. When I take a break from "the computer", I spend time with
                my kids, play retro console games on my RG353PS linux handheld, watch
                movies, read cyberpunk fiction along with other nerd stuff I forgot to
                mention here.
