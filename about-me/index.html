                <p>
                    I'm a programmer currently working towards my BS in Computer
                    Science. I always dreamt about what a career in software
                    development would feel like but I have never developed
                    software in a professional capacity, only personal projects
                    where I was the sole developer. I have used linux for 15
                    years and have grown to love it strengths and understand its
                    weaknesses. Lately, I have been focused on systems
                    programming and hardware specifically in the areas of
                    bare-metal, x86-64 linux, and also embedded linux.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first programming language I learned was QBasic, on my
                    IBM 286 clone running windows 95 back in 1995. I'm currently
                    taking a deep dive into c programming and low level
                    concepts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I have spare development time, I make game
                    prototypes(code,art,music). and when I take a break from
                    "the computer", I play retro console games on my RG353PS
                    linux handheld, watch movies and read cyberpunk fiction.
